# Credit Card Default Prediction

Credit Card payment default occurs when you fail to pay the Minimum Amount Due (MAD) on the credit card for a few consecutive months. Usually, the default notice is sent by the card issuer after 6 consecutive missed payments.

Consequences of Credit card payment default

Lawful Punishments
Suspended Credit Card Account
Detrimental Effect on Credit Score
High-Interest Rates
Asset Possession
In this project we classify customers as potential defaulters given personal and 6 months banking details.

## Dataset Features

- **Credit Limit**: Amount of the given credit (in dollars): it includes both the individual consumer credit and his/her family (supplementary) credit
- **Sex**: (1=male; 2=female)
- **Education**: (1=graduate school; 2=university; 3=high school; 4=other)
- **Marital Status**: (1=married; 2=single; 3=others)
- **Age**: years
- **History of past payment**: The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 8 = payment delay for eight months; 9 = payment delay for nine months and above
- **Amount of bill statement**: (dollars) for past 6 months
- **Amount of previous payment** past 6 months
